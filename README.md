# PicDrive
PicDrive is an Android application to store images and it uses 1Password for authentication and Firebase storage to store the images.I have made this Android app for 1Password Hackathon hosted on Hashnode.
### So what is PicDrive?
As I said PicDrive is an Android application to store images on the remote server. It basically uses Passage for authenticating users with the passkey method which reduces the complexity of generally used authentication methods (e.g. OTP, Email magic link, Email password etc). It also uses Firebase storage to store the images uploaded by the users.
### Why PicDrive ?
The authentication method used in PicDrive by Passage is more secure than other methods because it uses biometrics and a simple passkey which is hard to replicate.
